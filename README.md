<h2>Damage Detection</h2>
The Damage Detection component of MechanicMate plays a crucial role in assessing the severity of vehicle damages. It utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze various factors, such as images or descriptions provided by the user, to accurately evaluate the extent of the damage.
How It Works<br>
Input: Users can upload images or provide descriptions of the vehicle damages through the MechanicMate website.<br>
Analysis: The Damage Detection module processes the provided information using sophisticated algorithms to analyze and identify the type and severity of the damage.<br>
Severity Assessment: Based on the analysis, the module determines the severity level of the damage, ranging from minor to moderate or severe.<br>
Recommendation Generation: The severity assessment is then used to generate recommendations for nearby mechanics who are experienced in handling similar types of damages.<br>
<h2>Algorithms Used : </h2>
Non personalized recommendation system
